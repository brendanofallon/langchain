FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------

When responding to me use one of the two formats:


**Option 1:**
Use this only if you don't know the answer and want the human to use a tool.
Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
    "action_input": string \\ The input to the action, must be valid json
}}}}
```

**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here, must be valid json
}}}}
```"""

SUFFIX = """TOOLS
------
Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question.
 Tools should only be used if you cannot answer the question yourself, if the answer requires executing python or shell code, or if the user asks about events after 2021. 
 If human asks about python code or terminal commands, do not run any tools and return the requested code directly. Only use the Terminal tool to actually execute terminal code. The tools the human can use are:

{{tools}}
